[![status](https://github.com/mjd3/tracikpy/workflows/Release%20Tracikpy/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mjd3/tracikpy/actions) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/mjd3/tracikpy/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/mjd3/tracikpy?branch=main) [![style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

This repo contains Python bindings for TracIK based on the ROS packages and SWIG bindings provided by TRACLabs [here](https://bitbucket.org/traclabs/trac_ik/src/master/) (see [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7363472) for implementation details) and the updates provided by Clemens Eppner [here](https://bitbucket.org/clemi/trac_ik/src/devel/). For now, it only supports Ubuntu operating systems. The goal of this repo is to encapsulate these bindings into a Python package that can be easily installed using `pip` (with `numpy` as the only Python dependency) and can be used independently of ROS. This package does still contain several system-level dependencies (`eigen`, `orocos-kdl`, `nlopt`, `urdf`, and `kdl_parser`); if you have already installed ROS then these will be installed already. If not, you can install using `apt-get`:
```
sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev liborocos-kdl-dev libkdl-parser-dev liburdf-dev libnlopt-dev
```
Note that for Ubuntu 20.04, `libnlopt-cxx-dev` is also needed to install the C++ bindings for `nlopt`.

Main differences from original library/bindings:
 - ROS and Boost dependencies removed (replaced with C++ standard library calls).
 - Installable via `pip`, taking advantage of SWIG support in `setuptools.Extension`.
 - Added forward kinematics.
 - Simplified Python wrapper.
 - Added basic unit tests through `pytest`

## Install
Clone the repo and install using `pip`:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/mjd3/tracikpy.git
pip install tracikpy/
```
That's it!

## Quickstart

Here is an example script showing how this package can be used to calculate inverse kinematics:
```python
import numpy as np
from tracikpy import TracIKSolver

ee_pose = np.array([[ 0.0525767 , -0.64690764, -0.7607537 , 0.        ],
                    [-0.90099786, -0.35923817,  0.24320937, 0.2       ],
                    [-0.43062577,  0.67265031, -0.60174996, 0.4       ],
                    [ 0.        ,  0.        ,  0.        , 1.        ]])

ik_solver = TracIKSolver(
    "data/franka_panda.urdf",
    "panda_link0",
    "panda_hand",
)
qout = ik_solver.ik(ee_pose, qinit=np.zeros(ik_solver.number_of_joints))
print(qout)
```
which yields:
```
[-0.05331206 -1.75956216  0.6304369  -3.00941705  1.28849325  0.46002026  2.58126884]
```
Note that the `qinit` argument is optional; if you do not include it then it will be set to a configuration chosen uniformly at random between the robot's joint limits.

You can also check the solution using forward kinematics:
```python
ee_out = ik_solver.fk(qout)
ee_diff = np.linalg.inv(ee_pose) @ ee_out
trans_err = np.linalg.norm(ee_diff[:3, 3], ord=1)
angle_err = np.arccos(np.trace(ee_diff[:3, :3] - 1) / 2)
assert trans_err < 1e-3
assert angle_err < 1e-3 or angle_err - np.pi < 1e-3
```
which should not output any assertion errors since the pose is close to the desired pose.

## Unit Tests
To run the unit tests for this project, install the repo with the `test` option and run `pytest`:
```shell
cd /path/to/tracikpy
pip install -e .[tests]
pytest
```

## TODO
 - GitHub Actions CI for MacOS and Windows
 - Migrate SWIG std_vector.i templates to numpy.i (see [here](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/swig.interface-file.html))
 - Integrate CIBuildWheel?
